## Overview

This is a fullstack chat application built using modern web technologies:

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface.
- **Firebase v9**: For backend services including authentication, real-time database, and hosting.
- **ChakraUI**: For a sleek and accessible UI component library.
- **NextJS**: For server-side rendering and optimized performance.

The application supports login authentication using Google Sign-In, providing a seamless and secure way for users to access the chat platform.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
